# Exoplanet Habitability - PHL Exoplanet Catalog
## Introduction
Welcome to the Exoplanet Habitability project, where we delve into the fascinating realm of exoplanet habitability using the Planetary Habitability Laboratory's (PHL) Exoplanet Catalog. This project aims to unravel the mysteries of exoplanetary habitability through a systematic data-driven approach, employing various techniques in data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning.

## Resolving Class Imbalance with Simple Oversampling Strategy
Addressing class imbalance is crucial for accurate model training. In this section, we discuss the implementation of a simple oversampling strategy to balance the classes in the dataset, ensuring fair representation of habitable and non-habitable exoplanets.

## Data Analysis through Visualization
Data visualization is a powerful tool for gaining insights into the characteristics of exoplanets. Through visualizations, we explore the distribution of key features, identify patterns, and uncover potential correlations that may influence habitability.

## Preprocessing of Data
Data preprocessing is essential for preparing the dataset for model training. This step involves handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables to ensure optimal performance of machine learning algorithms.

## Feature Selection
Effective feature selection enhances model interpretability and generalization. We employ techniques such as permutation importance and wrapper methods to identify the most influential features for predicting exoplanet habitability.

## Train-Test Split
To evaluate the performance of our machine learning models, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. This ensures that our models are trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data to assess their ability to generalize to new observations.

## Modelling with Supervised Learning
Supervised learning models are trained using labeled data to predict the habitability of exoplanets. We experiment with various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines to build predictive models.

## Supervised Models Comparison
Comparing the performance of different supervised learning models provides valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Through rigorous evaluation metrics and visualizations, we assess the efficacy of each model in predicting exoplanet habitability.

## Experimenting with Unsupervised Learning
In addition to supervised learning, we explore unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering to uncover hidden patterns and structures within the dataset. This exploratory analysis enhances our understanding of the underlying characteristics of exoplanets.

## Conclusion
The Exoplanet Habitability project represents a multidisciplinary effort to advance our understanding of exoplanetary habitability using data-driven approaches. By combining data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning, we aim to unlock new insights into the conditions conducive to life beyond our solar system.
